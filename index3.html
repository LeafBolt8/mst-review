            <h2>Abstract</h2>
            <p>This paper juxtaposes decolonial thinking with contemporary Roman Catholic homilizing. The fundamental question that undergirds this exploration is whether a decolonialized Roman Catholic homily is even possible in the U.S. Since more preachers and theologians are familiar with postcolonial theory rather than decolonial thinking, the first step in this exploration is to define postcolonial practice and theory – as much as that is possible – and illustrate how it has been employed in recent theorizing about preaching as well as highlight some of its limits. After a necessary autobiographical excursus to locate the author in this discussion, we then turn to an exploration of the nature of decoloniality and a consideration of the nature of Roman Catholic homilizing. Finally, we will propose four specific homiletic lenses and strategies that could contribute to a more decolonialized path to Roman Catholic Homileties. At the same time, there is a recognition that, given Roman Catholic canon law about homilizing, authentic decolonialized preaching in this context is virtually impossible.</p>

            <h2>Introduction</h2>
            <p>Postcolonial is a sprawling category that emerged in the second half of the 20th century. While not explicitly claiming that moniker, the field first surfaced through the genre of literary fiction. Novels such as Chinua Achebe's <i>Things Fall Apart</i> helped pave the way for this unique approach in the late 1950s. The emergence of postcolonial theorizing soon followed. Some root the origins of such theory in Frantz Fanon's 1961 <i>Les Damnés de la Terre</i> while others elect Edward Said's 1978 <i>Orientalism</i> as the originator of this theory. Other canonical figures in the emergence of postcolonial theorizing are Gayatri Chakravorty Spivak and Homi Bhabha. The 1989 publication <i>The Empire Writes Back</i> consolidated much of postcolonial thought of the time and was enormously influential to its growing influence in various academies.</p>
        </div>
        
        <div class="section">
            <h2>Postcolonial preaching and its limits</h2>
            <p>Christian preaching originated as an event. It was only after a significant gestation period that this ubiquitous early church praxis eventually gave birth to intentional theologies of preaching. The historical foundation for this assertion lies in the fact that preaching by the followers of Jesus – who himself brought about a revolution in perceiving God's reign through his preaching – existed even before the evolution of the New Testament and both fueled and paralleled the emergence of that body of writings as well as Christianity itself. On the other hand, the first explicit Christian theology of preaching is attributed to St. Augustine (d. 430), in particular his <i>De Doctrina Christiana</i>.</p>
            <p>Theologies of preaching – which especially blossomed in the 16th century in the West – are not a dispensable addendum to this central ministerial act. As David Tracy has pointedly recognized: all praxis is theory laden. Thus, it is incumbent upon preachers as reflective practitioners to excavate and evaluate the often unspoken presuppositions and latent theories foundation to our preaching. Part of that process is juxtaposing our preferred praxis and theories of preaching with other models in a dialogue of mutual critique. Such is essential so that our preaching does not become marooned in the rut of an unexamined word.</p>

            <h2>An autobiographical excursus</h2>
            <p>As a Caucasian male cleric, raised in the Midwest who was privileged with a quality education and economic security, my first ministerial assignment to the largest Roman Catholic Women's college in the country was eye-opening. While exposed to liberal theologies in the early 1970's, I was unprepared for the transcultural immersion that confronted me in 1975 at the College of St. Catherine in St. Paul, Minnesota which proudly advertised itself as the school "Where every year is the year of the woman!"</p>
            <p>Subsequent studies in Germany and France, where I never achieved real language fluency, were also humbling. My Danish Doktor Vater created a dissertation topic that required me to move to Paris because, as he often said, "you Americans think the world revolves around you." France under the socialist president François Mitterrand while Ronald Regan was president of the United States was not a comfortable place for this linguistically challenged student from mid-America. I confess to sewing a Canadian flag to my backpack and regularly admitting to being a Canadian student qui parlait très mal Français.</p>

            <h2>Decoloniality: A new homiletic ripple</h2>
            <p>Moments and movements are difficult to define. Decoloniality, alternately considered moment and movement is no exception. One helpful step may be to distinguish as much as possible between the frameworks of coloniality-decoloniality from those of colonial-postcolonial. To begin with, leading figures in the field do not consider decoloniality a theory or mode of critical thought as much as it is "a way, option, standpoint, analytic, project, practice and praxis." Continuing in that mode, semiotician Walter Mignolo distinguishes decolonial <i>thinking</i> from postcolonial <i>theory</i> genealogically: the latter located in French post-structuralism, the former in "the dense history of planetary decolonial thinking." Britta Saal elucidates:</p>
            <blockquote>
                While postcolonial critique undertakes an extension of Foucault, Gramsci, Derrida, and Lacan, while it realizes the problem of Orientalism (Said) and finally departs in its reflections from the postcolonial situation in India, decolonial critique has its roots in Latin America. It is based on approaches by critics of Eurocentrism like José Carlos Mariátegui, on dependency theory, and on liberation philosophy.
            </blockquote>

            <h2>Roman Catholic homilizing within a benevolent empire</h2>
            <p>A persistent theme in postcolonial theory is imperialism, often framed through the category of empire. While admitting, along with Travis, that "postcolonial theory's conceptual vocabulary is itself a site of continuing negotiation," Ronald Suny provides a working definition that suits our purposes. He explains that empire is "a particular form of domination or control between two units set apart in a hierarchical, inequitable relationship ... in which a metropole dominates a periphery to the disadvantage of the periphery."</p>
            <p>While it may seem odd for some to situate Roman Catholic homilizing within some kind of benevolent empire, it seems a justifiable exercise given the restrictions on this practice in Roman Catholicism. The homily is a very specific form of preaching in my tradition. Some of its characteristics are:</p>
            <ol>
                <li>It is a liturgical event, which not only occurs within the context of Eucharist or other official sacramental services but is theologically and canonically understood to be "of" and not simply "in" the liturgy;</li>
                <li>Since the homily is itself a liturgical event and the official teaching of the Roman Catholic Church is that the liturgy is performed by Christ, head and members, then the assembly with Christ are subjects and not "objects" of the homily;</li>
                <li>The canonical presumption is that, since the homily is a central liturgical act, it can only be performed by the ordained [deacon, priest or bishop] within worship.</li>
            </ol>
        </div>
        
        <div class="section">
            <h2>Embracing the kin-dom with holy subversion</h2>
            <p>It never occurred to me that acquiring a Ph.D. in largely western liturgics was becoming certified as an imperial ally. While a bit overstated, a large part of my personal and academic journey sketched above has been unlearning, reinventing and evolving into a committed subversive.</p>
            <p>Currently I am in my 15th year of regular presiding and preaching at a vibrant, socially active, justice inclined, LGBTQ+ welcoming and politically left leaning community with a substantial on-line outreach. That kind of extended pulpit exposure does have its drawbacks, especially when it comes to staying fresh and avoiding the ever present challenge of repeating oneself; homily preparation has never before taken so much time and effort. On the other hand, the upside of such a sustained homiletic presence is the opportunity to develop deep levels of mutual respect and trust with an assembly, which allows one to be more theologically provocative and socially critical while still being heard.</p>
        </div>
        
        <div class="section">
            <h2>Summary</h2>
            <p>This paper has attempted to juxtapose decolonial thinking – differentiated from postcolonial theory – with contemporary Roman Catholic homilizing. The fundamental question that undergirds this exploration is whether a decolonialized Roman Catholic homily is even possible in the U.S. While my first instinct was to respond with a definitive "no," upon reflection that response seems unnuanced. First of all, there are some Roman Catholic Clergy who speak from a subaltern position: I have taught Dalit priests from India, undocumented clergy from Guatemala, and others whose life journey authenticates their subaltern credentials. On the other hand, these are ordinarily educated males. Furthermore, the fact that all women are canonically barred from homilizing in the Roman Catholic Church, the answer to that question has to be that decolonial homilizing in the U.S. is virtually non-existent.</p>
            <p>Analogously, one could ask, "Will we ever experience the fulness of God's reign in our lifetimes?" While both a socio-political and theological analysis of current global realities in my opinion evokes a resounding "no," that does not mean that we should not strive towards such a goal. Similarly, while I do believe that in the current configuration of Roman Catholic polity an authentically decolonialized homileties is virtually impossible, this does not mean, however, that it should not be a worthy goal. Such will require Roman Catholic clerics and those who aspired to that serious self-reflection about their instinctive modes of thinking, sources of wisdom, willingness to be subversively faithful, and learning as far as possible to give voice to subaltern narratives as much as possible. This will undoubtedly trigger pushback, public critique and even conflict. While such is not the goal, it seems the inevitable cost of decolonializing Roman Catholic pulpits positioned to feed all people with renewed dignity and unassailable respect.</p>
